There are many types of memory in a computing system, but all with
the same purpose: store data.

Memories have different technologies, capacities, speed, energy consumption,
cost per byte stored and volatibility. These characteristics allow us to
define a __memory hierarchy__:

As you can see, speed and cost increase as we go higher (it is not in the image
but energy consumption does too!) and capacity decreases.

The "speed" here means the time it takes to read/write a byte.
